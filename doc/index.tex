\section{N2O: Web Framework}

\paragraph{}
N2O was started as the first Erlang Web Framework
that uses WebSocket protocol only. We saved great compatibility with Nitrogen
and added many improvements, such as binary page construction,
binary data transfer, minimized process spawns, transmission of all events over the WebSocket
and work within Cowboy processes. N2O renders pages several times faster than Nitrogen.

\subsection{Wide Coverage}
N2O is unusual in that it solves problems in different web development domains
and stays small and concise at the same time. Started as a Nitrogen concept
of server-side framework it can also build client-side offline applications
using the same source code. This became possible with powerful Erlang JavaScript Parse
Transform which enabling live compilation of Erlang code to JavaScript with keeping 
interoperability between Erlang and JavaScript pieces. Also you can use Elixir, LFE and Joxa languages for backend development.

\paragraph{}
N2O supports DSL and HTML templates. This allows you to code JavaScript
control elements in Erlang and perform inline rendering with DSL using
the same code base for both client and server sides.
Thus, N2O has many faces and can  satisfy very different needs. You could create mobile applications using server-side rendering
for both HTML and JavaScript, reduce CPU consumption and improve battery life of a mobile device.
Or you could create rich offline desktop applications using Erlang JavaScript compiler.

\subsection*{Why Erlang in Web?}
We have benchmarked all major web frameworks built using functional
languages and Cowboy was still the winner. The chart below shows raw HTTP
performance of functional and C-based languages with concurrent
primitives (Go, D and Rust) on a VAIO Z notebook with i7640M processor.

\paragraph{}
Erlang was built for low latency processing of binary data streams in telecom systems.
Fundamental design goals included high manageability, scalability
and extreme concurrency. Thinking of WebSocket channels as of binary
telecom streams and interpret web pages as user binary sessions
could explain why Erlang can be an ultimate choice 
among other alternatives for web development.

\paragraph{}
Using Erlang for web programming allows you to unleash the full power of telecom systems for
building web-scale, event-driven, message-passing, NoSQL, asynchronous, non-blocking,
reliable, highly-available, performance, secure, real-time, distributed applications.
See Erlang: The Movie II.

\paragraph{}
N2O outperforms full Nitrogen stack with only 2X raw HTTP Cowboy
performance downgrade thus upgrading rendering performance several
times compared to any other functional web framework. And, for
sure, it's faster than raw HTTP performance of Node.js.

\subsection{Rich and Lightweight Applications}
There are two approaches for designing client/server communication.
The first one is 'data-on-wire'. With this approach only JSON, XML or binary
data are transferred over RPC and REST channels, HTML rendering
is performed on the client side. This is the most suitable approach for building desktop
applications. Examples include Chaplin/CoffeeScript, Meteor
and ClojureScript. This approach is also applicable to build mobile clients.

\paragraph{}
Another approach is to perform as much rendering as possible on server side and 
then send rendered parts of page to the client. This approach suits 
mobile web much better since it saves precious resources on client side.


\paragraph{}
With N2O you're able to create both types of applications. You can use N2O REST framework
for desktop applications based on Cowboy REST API along with DTL
templates for initial HTML renderings for mobile applications.
You also can use Nitrogen's DSL-based approach for modelling parts of pages
as widgets and control elements, thanks to rich
Nitrogen's elements collections provided by Nitrogen community.

\paragraph{}
In those cases when your system is built upon Erlang infrastructure, N2O
is your ultimate choice for fast and simple web prototyping that keeps yor codebase clean and readable.
N2O abstracts progammer from dealing with annoying server-to-client machinery and allows to use all Erlang services directly.

\paragraph{}
You can also create offline applications using Erlang JavaScript compiler
just the way you would use ClojureScript, JScala, Elm, WebSharper
or any other similar tool. N2O includes: REST micro frameworks,
server-side and client-side rendering engines,
WebSocket events streaming, JavaScript generation
and JavaScript macro system along with {\bf AVZ} authorization
library (Facebook, Google, Twitter, Github, Microsoft), key-value storages
access library {\bf KVS} and {\bf MQS} Message Bus client library (GProc, RabbitMQ).

\subsection{JSON and BERT}
N2O uses JSON and BERT. All messages passed over
WebSockets are encoded in native Erlang External Term Format.
It is easy to parse it in JavaScript with {\bf dec(msg)}
and it helps to avoid complexity on the server side. Please refer
to \footahref{http://bert-rpc.org}{http://bert-rpc.org} for detailed information.

\subsection{DSL and Templates}
Nitrogen was loved for the simple and elegant way of how it constructs typed
HTML with internal DSL which is similar to Scala Lift,
OCaml Ocsigen and Haskell Blaze approaches. That makes possible to develop a library of reusable control
elements and components in the host language.

\paragraph{}
Template-based approach (Yesod, ASP, PHP, JSP, Rails, Yaws and ChicagoBoss)
requires programmers to deal with raw HTML. It allows
defining pages in terms of top-level controls, placeholders
and panels. N2O does not limit programmer to use both approaches whenever it would be needed.

\paragraph{}
The main N2O advantage is its sutability for large-scale projects without sacrificing simplicity and comfort of prototyping solutions in fast and dynamic manner. 
Below is an example of complete Web Chat implementation using
WebSockets that shows how  Templates, DSL and asynchronous
inter-process communication work in N2O.

\newpage

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=chat.erl]
    -module(chat).
    -compile(export_all).
    -include_lib("n2o/include/wf.hrl").

    main() -> 
      [ #dtl { file="index", 
               bindings=[{title,"Chat"},{body,body()}] } ].

    body() ->
        {ok,Pid} = wf:async(fun() -> loop() end),

      [ #span    { id=title,       body="Your chatroom name: " }, 
        #textbox { id=userName,    body="Anonymous" },
        #panel   { id=chatHistory, class=chat_history },
        #textbox { id=message },
        #button  { id=sendButton,  source=[userName,message],
                                   body="Send", 
                                   postback={chat,Pid} } ].

    event({chat,Pid}) ->
        Username = wf:q(userName),
        Message = wf:q(message),
        wf:reg(room),
        Pid ! {message, Username, Message}.

    loop() ->
        receive { message, Username, Message} ->
                  Terms = [ #span { body=Username }, ": ",
                            #span { body=Message }, #br{} ],
                  wf:insert_bottom(chatHistory, Terms),
                  wf:flush(room) end, loop().
\end{lstlisting}

Just try to build the similar functionality with your favorite language/framework and feel the difference!

\subsection*{Changes from Nitrogen}
We took a liberty to break some compatibility with the original
Nitrogen framework, mostly because we wanted to have a clean codebase
and achieve better performance. However, it's still possible to port
Nitrogen web sites to N2O quite esily. E.g., N2O returns id and class semantics
of HTML and not {\bf html\_id}.

\paragraph{}
We simplified HTML rendering by not using
{\bf html\_encode} which should be handled by application layer.

\paragraph{}
Nitrogen.js, originally created by Rusty Klophaus, was removed 
because of the pure WebSocket nature of N2O which doesn't
require XHR helper methods on the client-side anymore. XHR fallback
handling by using 'Bullet' library written by Lo√Øc Hoguin was added as the replacemnt.

\paragraph{}
We also removed {\bf simple\_bridge} and optimized N2O on each level to
unlock maximum performance and simplicity. We hope you will enjoy
using N2O. We are fully convinced it is the most efficient way to
build Web applications in Erlang.

\paragraph{}
Original Nitrogen already was tested in production under high load and we
decided to remove {\bf nprocreg} process registry along 
with {\bf{action\_comet}} heavy process creation. N2O creates a single
process for an async WebSocket handler, all asynchronous operations
are handled within Cowboy processes.

\paragraph{}
Also, we introduced new levels of abstraction. You can extend
the set of available protocols (Nitrogen, Heartbeat, Binary), change protocol formatters (BERT,
JSON, MessagePack, BED), inject your code on almost any level. The code structure
is clean and Nitrogen compatibility layer is fully detachable from N2O.
